# UnityCameraShaker
Simple script for camera shaking effect in Unity.

How to use: The main script (CameraShaker) is meant to be put on a gameobject sitting at a local position of (0f, 0f, 0f), parented to another one that moves if it is meant to move.

I've added two other dummy scripts, you can play around easily with all the values and press shake button (on DummyCameraShaker) while in play mode to see the result.
